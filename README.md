Provide the microservices architecture and the practices I'm going to build with microservices.

## Microservices definition

The foundation of microservies architectures (MSA) is about developing a single application as a suite of small and independent services that running in its own process, developed, and deployed independently.

The key idea is that by looing at the functionalities offered from the monolith, we can identify the required business capabilities. Then those business capabilities can be implemented as fully-indenpendent, fine-grained and self-contained service. They may be implemented on top of different technology stacks and each service is addressing a very specific and limited business scope.
